\arguments{
\item{data}{\link{data.frame} from which the descriptive statistics are
calculated.}

\item{id_var}{\link{character} The name of the id variable. Defaults to \code{ getOption("sdc.id_var")} so that you can provide \code{options(sdc.id_var = "my_id_var")} at the top of your script.}

\item{val_var}{\link{character} vector of value variables on which descriptive
statistics are computed.}

\item{by}{\link{character} vector of grouping variables.}

\item{zero_as_NA}{\link{logical} If TRUE, zeros in 'val_var' are treated as NA.}

\item{fill_id_var}{\link{logical} Only for very specific use cases. For example:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_var} contains \code{NA} values which represent missing values in the sense
that there actually exist values identifying the entity but are unknown (or
deleted for privacy reasons).
\item \code{id_var} contains \code{NA} values which result from the fact that an
observation features more than one  confidential identifier and not all of
these identifiers are present in each observation. Examples for such
identifiers are the role of a broker in a security transaction or the role of
a collateral giver in a credit relationship.
}

If \code{TRUE}, \code{NA} values within \code{id_var} will internally be filled with
\verb{<filled_[i]>}, assuming that all \code{NA} values of \code{id_var} can be treated as
different small entities for statistical disclosure control purposes. Thus,
set \code{TRUE} only if this is a reasonable assumption.

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{key_vars}{\link{character} Only for specific use cases in which duplicate
values in \code{val_var} occur. This can happen for example due to
\itemize{
\item grouped aggregations, such as \code{sdc_descriptives_DT[, mean_val_1 := mean(val_1, na.rm = TRUE), by = "id"]} or
\item 1:n merges, such as \code{merge(sdc_dups_credits_DT, sdc_dups_lender_groups_DT, by = "lender")}.
}

In these cases, you need to use \code{key_vars} to specify those columns which
identify each row. Usually, these are one or more id variables and time
variables.}

\item{model}{The estimated model object. Can be a model type like \link{lm}, \link{glm}
and various others (anything which can be handled by \code{\link[broom:reexports]{broom::augment()}}).}

\item{min_obs}{\link{integer} The minimum number of observations used to calculate
the minimum and maximum. Defaults to \code{getOption("sdc.n_ids", 5L)}. \emph{This is
not the number of distinct entities.}}

\item{max_obs}{\link{integer} The maximum number of observations used to calculate
the minimum and maximum. Defaults to \code{nrow(data)}. \emph{This is not the number
of distinct entities.}}
