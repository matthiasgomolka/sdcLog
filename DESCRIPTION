Description: Tools for researchers to explicitly show that their results
    comply to rules for statistical disclosure control imposed by research
    data centers. These tools help in checking descriptive statistics and
    models and in calculating extreme values that are not individual data.
    Also included is a simple function to create log files. The methods
    used here are described in the "Guidelines for the checking of output
    based on microdata research" by Bond, Brandt, and de Wolf (2015)
